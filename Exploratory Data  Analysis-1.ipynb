    "### Q1. What are the key features of the wine quality dataset? Discuss the importance of each feature in predicting the quality of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wine quality dataset consists of various chemical properties used to predict wine quality. The key features include:\n",
    "- **Fixed Acidity**: Tartaric acid content, important for the taste profile.\n",
    "- **Volatile Acidity**: Acetic acid level, high levels can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste.\n",
    "- **Citric Acid**: Adds freshness and enhances flavor, affecting wine stability.\n",
    "- **Residual Sugar**: The amount of sugar left after fermentation, crucial for sweetness.\n",
    "- **Chlorides**: Salt level, excessive chloride can negatively affect the taste.\n",
    "- **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: Prevents microbial growth, important for preservation.\n",
    "- **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: Sum of all sulfur compounds, critical for controlling spoilage.\n",
    "- **Density**: Related to alcohol and sugar content, affecting the wine's body.\n",
    "- **pH**: Wine’s acidity, an indicator of stability and shelf life.\n",
    "- **Sulphates**: Enhances flavor and is used as a preservative.\n",
    "- **Alcohol**: Affects mouthfeel and overall quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each feature contributes differently to the final quality, as they impact the wine’s taste, aroma, and stability."

    "\n",
    "During feature engineering, missing data in the wine quality dataset can be handled using several techniques:\n",
    "- **Mean/Median Imputation**: Replacing missing values with the mean/median of the column. This is simple but may distort the data's variance.\n",
    "  - *Advantage*: Fast and easy.\n",
    "  - *Disadvantage*: Can introduce bias, especially in skewed distributions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Mode Imputation**: Useful for categorical data, it replaces missing values with the most frequent value.\n",
    "  - *Advantage*: Suitable for discrete data.\n",
    "  - *Disadvantage*: May not be effective in datasets with diverse categories.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**: Replaces missing values based on the similarity to other data points.\n",
    "  - *Advantage*: Preserves relationships between variables.\n",
    "  - *Disadvantage*: Computationally expensive and may not perform well with large datasets.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Dropping Missing Data**: If the missing data percentage is low, the rows/columns can be dropped.\n",
    "  - *Advantage*: Simplifies the dataset.\n",
    "  - *Disadvantage*: Loss of information."
